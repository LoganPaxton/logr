## Installation

```

## Usage
To use this module, you need to add these few lines of code.
```javascript
const { Logger } = require("logr-v1")

const logr = new Logger(); // This will create a new Logr instance
```
Examples  
```javascript
logr.add("Text to log", "LOG"); // First argument is text to log. The second one is the type of log it will be (Eg. Log, error, warn)
logr.add("Error to log", "ERROR");
logr.add("Warning to log", "WARN");

logr.output = true // This will log to the console and to the log file if set to true
```
